            <p>My name's Agneya and I would say that coding is something I have been interested in since my childhood days. At the age of 6, I started block coding with something called <b><u>LEGO MINDSTORMS</u></b>. Its something where you have a set of peices like a normal <b>set of legos</b> but later you have the options of adding sensors and also you have to program the main block, which is connected to all the pieces and sensors via cable. The main block or <b>brick</b> is basically the brain in which we send the code via the usb cable from your laptop. For example I made a project where I was to put in a sensor so that the robot would keep walking forward until it detected a wall.
